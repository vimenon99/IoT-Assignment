### **GitHub Repository Description:**
> **IoT Environmental Sensor Data System**  
> This project retrieves environmental sensor data from ThingSpeak and displays it on a Flask-based web application. It simulates sensor readings and updates the ThingSpeak channel at regular intervals. The frontend dynamically fetches and presents the latest sensor data.

# IoT Environmental Sensor Data System

## Project Overview  
This project is an IoT-based system that collects, processes, and displays environmental sensor data from **ThingSpeak**. The system simulates sensor readings (temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels) and updates the ThingSpeak channel at regular intervals. A **Flask web application** retrieves and visualizes the data dynamically.

---

## Features  
✔️ Collects real-time environmental data (simulated)  
✔️ Sends data to ThingSpeak using its API  
✔️ Fetches the latest 5-hour data from ThingSpeak  
✔️ Displays sensor data on a Flask-based web interface  
✔️ Uses JavaScript to dynamically update the webpage

## Installation and Setup  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IoT-Environmental-Sensor.git
cd IoT-Environmental-Sensor
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**  
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Set Up ThingSpeak API Key**  
- Create a ThingSpeak channel and get the **API Key**.
- Update the Python script (`sensor_data.py`) with your **ThingSpeak Write API Key**.

### **5. Run the Sensor Data Simulation**  
```sh
python sensor_data.py
```

### **6. Start the Flask Web Application**  
```sh
python app.py
```
- Open your browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## Reflection  
During this project, I encountered issues with fetching real-time data due to API rate limits. By optimizing request intervals and handling errors properly, I improved data retrieval reliability. This project helped me understand **IoT data flow, API integration, and web development.**
